# Overview

I'm using Pop!\_OS as my desktop OS, for a few main reasons:

- It's not super complicated. I don't want to go crazy with configuration.
- It's based on Ubuntu, which has fantastic support and comes with the entire Debian package ecosystem.
- It comes with some nice features out of the box, like a tiling window manager.
- It possibly has a bright future (with Cosmic DE).

Some other information about my setup:

- NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER
- AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core processor
- Two displays, primary is 1440p and secondary is 1080p.
