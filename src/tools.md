## Browsers

Pop!_OS comes with the Firefox browser. This is generally my default browser. However, I only use it with my "default" online identity. This generally does not include my professional or public identities. For these, I use Google Chrome. There, I have a public, student and professional profile, which I use to stay logged into specific websites.

### Extensions

I use Bitwarden as a password manager. Since the YouTube adblocker changes, I switched to uBlock Origin. I feel somewhat uncomfortable using it, but when I'm on my desktop I want to be productive and not be distracted. On my phone, where I spend more time browsing, I don't have any adblockers installed. Once I start earning some money, maybe I'll switch to paid versions of some services.


## Applications

I use Thunderbird as my emailclient. 

## Terminal

I use `kitty` as my terminal emulator, with `fish` as my shell and `starship.rs` as my prompt.

I started using Neovim recently, with kickstart.vim as my base configuration.

## Programming languages

### Python

I use `pyenv` to manage Python installations. NOTE:
